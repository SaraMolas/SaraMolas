## Hi there! I'm Sara 🙌

#### I study internal representations in both biological and artificial neural systems: how they are formed, how they can be interpreted, and how they shape behavior.

I’m a **Research Scientist** with a PhD in Systems & Computational Neuroscience from UCL & QMUL, now transitioning into **AI safety research**. My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and complex systems: basically taking messy, complex data (rodent brain recordings or neural network activations) and turning it into insights that actually make sense.

Research Highlights

- PhD research: Led full-cycle experiments and computational analyses to understand spatial representation in the mouse hippocampus (“the brain’s GPS”).
- Mechanistic interpretability: Completed a research project mentored by Stefan Heimersheim (at FARAI) on computation in superposition, resulting in a NeurIPS workshop paper and LessWrong article.
- Cross-domain representations: collaborated on a recent NeurIPS workshop paper applying Sparse Autoencoders to biological neural data, showing how interpretability tools can bridge AI and Neuroscience.

🌱 Current focus: **AI alignment and mechanistic interpretability**. 

🤝 Collaboration: interested in projects on **Mechanistic interpretability**, or EA-aligned applied research questions.

⚡ Hobbies: dancing, painting, and anything outdoorsy!
