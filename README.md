### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Sara🙌, a recently-graduated PhD in Circuits Neuroscience at [UCL](https://barry-lab.com/people/). 

**About me:**

- 🎓 I just completed a PhD in Circuits Neuroscience. Although it might sound like I spent all of my PhD looking through a microscope in a white lab coat, I actually was in front of my computer most of the time!🤓  I used several mathematical and statistical analyses to identify patterns in large datasets, employing quantitative methods to extract comprehensible information to get us a step closer to understanding the most complex algorithm known to humankind, the brain. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about supervised Machine Learning models.
- 👯 I’m looking to participate in more Kaggle challenges and Hackathons. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ☀️ Hobbies: bachata dancing, drawing, and anything outdoorsy!
