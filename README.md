### Hi there! I'm Sara🙌, a recently-graduated PhD in Systems & Computational Neuroscience at [UCL](https://barry-lab.com/people/)

**👋 About me:**

- 🎓 I just completed a PhD in Systems & Computational Neuroscience. Although it might sound like I spent all of my PhD looking through a microscope in a white lab coat, I actually was in front of my computer most of the time!🤓  I used several analytical and Machine Learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines, Bayesian Inference, and fast ICA, to extract insights from a high-dimensional, neural dataset. By employing quantitative methods, I extracted comprehensible information to get us a step closer to understanding the most complex algorithm known to humankind, the brain. 
- 🌱 I’m eager to expand my knowledge in AI interpretability.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate in projects related to AI interpretability and generative AI. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ☀️ Hobbies: bachata dancing, swimming, and anything outdoorsy!
