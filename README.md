## Hi there! I'm Sara 🙌

I’m a **Research Scientist and Data Scientist** with a PhD in Systems & Computational Neuroscience from UCL, now transitioning into **AI safety research**. My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and complex systems: basically taking messy, complex data (rodent brain recordings or neural network activations) and turning it into insights that actually make sense.

During my PhD, I independently led full-cycle research projects to investigate the internal representations of the GPS in the mouse brain. More recently, I completed a Mech Interp research project, mentored by Stefan Heimersheim, which resulted in a NeurIPS workshop paper and a LessWrong publication.

🌱 Current focus: **AI alignment and mechanistic interpretability**. 

🤝 Collaboration: interested in projects on **Mechanistic interpretability**, or EA-aligned applied research questions.

⚡ Hobbies: dancing, netball, and anything outdoorsy!

### 💻 Tech & Tools
- Python: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Neural networks, FastICA, Bayesian Inference, SVM, Gradient Boosted Trees, random forests
