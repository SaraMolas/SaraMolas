# Hi there! I'm Sara 🙌

I’m a **Research Scientist and Data Scientist** with a PhD in Systems & Computational Neuroscience from UCL, now transitioning into **AI safety and mechanistic interpretability research**. My work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and complex systems: I love taking high-dimensional, noisy data and turning it into clear, interpretable insights.  

During my PhD, I led full-cycle research projects to investigate the internal representations of the rodent spatial navigation system. More recently, I completed a mechanistic interpretability research project as part of the SPAR programme, mentored by Stefan Heimersheim, resulting in a NeurIPS workshop paper and a LessWrong publication.

## 🌱 Current focus
I'm diving deep into **AI alignment and mechanistic interpretability**, exploring how models represent knowledge internally and how we can make AI more transparent, reliable, and aligned.

## 🤝 Collaboration
I’m always interested in collaborating on projects related to **Mechanistic interpretability**, or interesting applied research questions.
